Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence represents one of the most significant technological advances of our time. This field encompasses various subdomains including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.

Machine learning algorithms enable computers to learn from data without explicit programming. These systems can identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time.

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to process complex data. This approach has revolutionized image recognition, speech processing, and language understanding.
